# Why?

This is mostly to study signals and understand their various implementations better as well as an exercise in API design.

I use this for prototypes and in my own projects and all features are written using a test-driven approach and the core primitives are *somewhat* stable.

**However** I am maintaining this in bursts, rather than steadily - so I don't advice using this for anything other than experiments at the moment.
