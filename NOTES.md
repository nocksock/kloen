# Notes and Todos

## TODOs

### TODO: consider not having .get() and .value?

at least by default? Should make a benchmark and keep only the fastest acessor, all of them are function calls eventually.

### TODO: align project structure with mokeys 

- src folder
- manual export for react


### TODO: Separate into behaviour like types

### TODO: inject extras as second param?

```
const $value = signal("foobar", reduce)
$value.reduce(() => {}) 
```

### TODO: consider if this has actually merit
